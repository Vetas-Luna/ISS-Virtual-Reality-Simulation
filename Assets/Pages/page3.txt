A cool flame is one that burns at around six hundred degrees celcius, but this is currently impossible to achieve in earth's gravity. Researchers with NASA's Flame Extinguishment studies discovered in 2012 that it was possible to create a flame before liquid fuel had been mixed with an oxidizer. Moving forward, data from tests for the Cool Flames Investigation with Gases have shown that this can also be achieved with gaseous fuel and could lead to the development of cleaner combustion engines in the future.
